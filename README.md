# Dart & Flutter Exports

The Dart & Flutter Exports extension automates the creation of Dart exporter files in your Dart or Flutter project, making it easier to manage and organize your code structure.

## Features

The extension provides the following features:

- **Recursive Export File Creation**: Automatically generates exporter files (`folder_name.dart`) recursively in specified directories.
- **Overwrite Confirmation**: Prompts the user to confirm overwriting existing exporter files or skip the current folder.
- **Intelligent Export Checks**: Improved checks to identify existing exporter files and avoid overwriting non-exporter files.

## Usage

Simply right click on a folder in your Dart/Flutter project and click on the "Generate Dart export files" option.

Remember that this operation works recursively, meaning that it will also create export files for subfolders.
